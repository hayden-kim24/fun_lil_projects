1. [Ongoing] Ln_norms (Started: 05/23/24) 

Motivation<br>: Got to learn about Ln Norm from Bidipta during the CTL session for CS221: Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques. Thought Ln norms were really cool so decided to explore what type of practical code I can write with!

- [Done] login_l0_norm.py: Created a simple login system that uses L0 distance to check if ID and PW match with the true ID and PW.  (Started: 05/23/24, Finished: 05/23/24)
